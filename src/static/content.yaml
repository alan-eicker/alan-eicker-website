  title: Hi, I'm Alan, a front end engineer who loves bringing creative user experiences to life.
  content: I began my journey @yearsExperience years ago as a junior front-end engineer for a small design company building ColdFusion websites for construction companies. A lot has changed since then. I've experienced front end devlopment grow from simple static HTML websites into complex API-driven JavaScript applications. Today, I lead the front-end efforts for an international law firm, working with technologies such as React, Redux, Jest, Rect Testing Library, and SharePoint.

        the begining of the Covid pandemic. It has always been something I wanted
        to do, and after 7 months of hard work, I published it to NPM along with the
        Atomik UI Core Sass Library.

        jobTitle: Manager of Creative Technology at Allstate
        content:
          Alan is a terrific Front-End developer with excellent knowledge in
          advanced scripting, CSS, HTML5, and UI architecture. While working with
          Alan, his attention to detail was very valuable as he worked on many high
          profile projects. When confronted with a problem, Alan always persevered
          and would develop components to the website that utilized complex functionality
          while maintaining flexibility and ease of implementation. I would recommend
          Alan to any business looking for a solid front-end developer.

          "If you had 5 Alans you could rule the software universe. So I recommend
          hiring him and having him train 4 other guys to be as good as he is. Alan
          is the kind of front-end developer UX designers like myself dream of: Can
          work directly out of Photoshop comps, leveraging all assets therein with
          zero confusion, follows wire-frames to the letter, focuses like a laser
          on delivering high-quality front-end code that is virtually indistinguishable
          from the comp he was handed and does all of this at lightning speed. It
          was typical for me to send him a Photoshop comp on Tuesday and think he
          was merely reviewing it when I passed his cubicle on Wednesday when in fact
          he had already turned the comp in to code -- using CSS to mirror much of
          the imagery that appeared in the comp. The guy's a killer. If you're smart,
          you'll put him in charge of your whole front-end team."

          'Alan is a beast of a developer. Seriously. The guy is a cyborg or
          something.  He is fearless when it comes to technology. I don''t think there
          is any problem you can throw at Alan that he can''t handle. All you have
          to say is "Hey Alan... do you think it''s possible?" His response: "Probably...
          just gimme a minute to figure it out". Fearless.'
